#  Useful Information

This is a collection of useful information gleaned from a variety of projects over quite a few years.  No particular order or importance. 

If a topic is here rather than under the docs for its project, it's likely because it has more to do with project management than usage or development.



**_Note. These GitHub Pages are translations of earlier Trac documents. We are still weeding through them to get all the links and formatting sorted out.  Thank you for your patience._**
