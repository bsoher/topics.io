# Vespa Bugs Email

## About vespa.bugs

`vespa.bugs@gmail.com` is the address we use for bug reporting. It's an ordinary gmail account to which I've made one configuration change. The change is that I've set it up to forward every mail that arrives in the account.

To see (or change) this configuration, log into the account, go into settings and then filters. There's one filter for every email address that receives mail forwarded from vespa.bugs.

That's really all there is to it! You never need to log in to this account unless you want to change something. 

As a bonus, it serves as a potentially useful log of problem reports. I used it once to count how many of our users had reported that they used Python 2.6 on Windows.
