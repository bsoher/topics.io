# XML-RPC Topics

This is a really simple Trac instance for documenting our Siemens code. As of this writing, it's mostly dedicated to the realtime project which tried to show MRS data processing on a FID by FID basis.  After that project, the successful (-ish) method was used to couple Vespa to the Siemens ICE pipeline for inline spectral analysis.
